# PCATE-balancing-code
This is the code accompanying with the paper Wang et. al. (2021).

# file description:
**`generate_data_1.R`** includes the source code for generating data under simulation setting 1. Similarily for `generate_data_2.R`, `generate_data_3.R` and `generate_data_4.R`.

**`kernel_cpp.cpp` and `core3_g_new.R`** include utility functions and optimizations for weights.

**`demo.R`** describes how to implement the methods in the simulation. Please check this file for details.
